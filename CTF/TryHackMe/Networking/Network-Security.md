# 📚 Study Notes #


# Learning Objectives #
- learn what is network security and its purpose
- what is CIA triad
- difference between HW and SW based security solution
- what is firewall, IDS, IPS, VPN concentrator
- and many more things ... 

# Introduction 
- A computer network **is a group of connected computers and devices**.
- Network security focuses on protecting these devices, the connections between them, and the data they carry by ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA).

- Network security is achieved using **hardware and software solutions**:
  - **Hardware security solutions** (*these are physical devices used to protect networks*): **firewall appliance** (*controls incoming and outgoing traffic using predefined rules*), 
**IDS** (*Intrusion Detection System*, *detects attacks or intrusion attempts*), **IPS** (*Intrusion Prevention System*, *detects and actively blocks attacks*), **VPN concentrator** (*encrypts network traffic to protect data confidentiality and integrity*).

  - **Software security solutions** (*these are programs installed on systems*): **Antivirus software** (*detects and blocks malicious files*), **host firewall** (*software-based firewalls built into operating systems, e.g. Windows Defender Firewall, macOS firewall*). 

## Why network security matters 

- Data breaches are extremely costly. According to IBM Security:

    - Average breach cost (2021): $4.24 million
    - Healthcare sector: ~$9.23 million
    - Education sector: ~$3.79 million

>[!IMPORTANT]
>**Strong network security is essential to reduce financial loss and protect sensitive data.**

>Solution: It runs on your computer and protects only that device, not the whole network.

# Methodology 

- Successful attacks require planning and information gathering, similar to planning wildlife photography, a military operation, or a burglary.

- Breaking into a network usually follows the **Cyber Kill Chain**, which **has seven steps**:

**1. Reconnaissance** – Gather information about the target (systems, users, IPs). <br>
**2. Weaponization** – Prepare malware or a malicious file. <br>
**3. Delivery** – Send the malicious file to the target (email, USB, etc.). <br>
**4. Exploitation** – Victim opens the file, triggering the attack. <br>
**5. Installation** – Malware installs on the system. <br>
**6. Command & Control (C2)** – Attacker gains remote control of the system. <br>
**7. Actions on Objectives** – Attacker achieves goals (e.g., data exfiltration). <br>

- The process is similar to a thief planning a break-in: observe first, plan entry, then steal valuables.

# Practical Example of Network Security

1. **Start AttackBox and target machine and open the terminal**. 
2. **Run Recon with Nmap**: Scan the target → find open services (FTP, SSH, HTTP).
   - command: `nmap MACHINE_IP`
3. **Connect to FTP**: Log in as anonymous and list files.
   - command: `ftp MACHINE_IP`; `anonymous`; then `ls` to list files.
4. **Download interesting files** (like secret.txt).
   - command: `get FILE_NAME` then `exit` 
5. **Read the file** with `cat` to find a password.
   - command: `cat FILE_NAME`
6. **Login with SSH as root** using the discovered password.
   - command: `ssh root@MACHINE_IP`
7. You now have full access to the system.
8. **Navigate folders** (`cd`, `ls`, `pwd`) and read flag files with `cat`.
